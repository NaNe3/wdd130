          <p>This is a mobile app which will allow the users to study the scriptures in groups. It has been said by general authorities that building a testimony cannot be done by yourself. Therefore this app was created by me to serve as a tool so as to study with your friends and family.</p>
          <p>I spent around 300 hours so far writing this project in React Native using SupaBase to facilitate the backend functions</p>

          <h2>twittyr</h2>
          <p>This is a website that I made during the pandemic of 2020. I remember having a ton of time on my hands so I created this website to perfectly replicate twitter and its basic functionality. This was long before the advent of AI and I certainly couldn't copy and paste the website therefore I had to create everythign from scratch.</p>
          <p>This was certainly a challenge and I imagine that I spent several months working on it. I used basic PHP and HTML to make this project work</p>

          <p>I worked for The Church of Jesus Christ of latter Day Saints from January of 2024 to August of 2024. I spent my time learning valuable skills such as React among other very important things. This was an excellent opportunity to really get out there and test the waters as a software engineer!</p>

          <h2>Imaginary Friends</h2>
          <p>This was my first opportunity to learn what the Software Industry was like. When I was 16 I interned at Imaginary Friends. This was a company in Yuma Arizona which specialized in design. This included photoshop, websites, etc. I was able to learn services such as FTP and wordpress while working for them!!</p>
