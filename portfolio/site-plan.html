      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        This site will be created for those who are interested in seeing the work which I have completed in the past. This will primarily be in the form of prior projects and testimonials from the hands of impressive employers!
      </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        The audience for this site will be potential employers, clients, and other web developers.
        <br><br>
        However, in the future there could be people who are interested in following me as an individual rather than one who has business motivations. This could also be a landing page to track the projects I am currently working on!
