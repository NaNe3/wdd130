          <h1>HIKING</h1>
          <p>I absolutely love exploring different parts of the country. I am constantly amazed at the great wonders which I discover as I traverse trails that prior I had no idea existed. I recall my disbelief as I witnessed Old Faithful exploding in a beautiful yet mysterious jet of steaming hot water. I remember my dumbstruck awe as I gazed down the vast crevices which littered the sides of the Grand Canyon. The more I explore my God's magnificent kingdom, the more I realize that he truly is the greatest artist to ever exist.</p>

          <h1>EDITING</h1>
          <p>I love photo and video editing. Ever since I was a wee lad I remember creating videos, movies, and other forms of cinematic entertainment. I saw things to be created and invested much time into making it happen. I am not sure if my parents spiked my cereal with aderal or some other form of mental stimulent but I often found myself lost in imagination. I to this day love to create things and this can be seen in my procedural creation of this website along with the several others which I have made. Let me know if there is some form in which we could collaborate!</p>

          <h1>Programming</h1>
          <p>Alright. Who is surprised? I am guessing that if you are taking the time to read through this, you will not be very surprised that I am very much enthusiastic about the software industry. I love that as I program I am forced to find ways to confront problems and build creative solutions. The more I create, the less my hunger to write code is satisfied! As of right now, you can see the work which I am doing on several projects not limited to flock, the mobile app which allows you to study with groups of people, and also twittyr, a replica of the old and long lost twitter!</p>
